The first part of the lab is making all of the functions in the LinkedList.c file making sure they all work. After the functions work correctly, you can move onto the SortedWordCount function in the sort.c file. After you complete that final function, you can move onto the main. You first print the unsorted list and the values and then you sort the list and print it out and use the SortedWordCount to attain the values for each item in the list and print that out. I believe the functions are a very important part of the lab and the lab manual roughly goes over each one but the LinkedList.h does go into more detail for the functions.

I first read through the manual to understand the lab. Then the next thing I did was work on all of the functions in LinkedList.c and make sure each one worked. Although my sort in LinkList.c seemed not to work properly. Many of my functions were wrong and had to be rewritten in order to work properly. Using the pseudocode made some of the functions much easier to write and went very well. I would probably do the same steps except next time be more careful for certain cases that certain functions have. I went to lab sections in order to ask questions and get help on the lab. I discussed the lab with classmates on certain ideas and algorithms. 

The lab ended up not working. I spent the most time on this lab out of all of the previous labs in the past. I liked learning the algorithms and how pointers work but I disliked the difficulty of implementing all of the concepts into my code and figuring out how it works out. I believe it was worthwhile but it was a very difficult lab. Maybe have more pseudocode or guidelines for some of the harder functions due to the fact of their difficulty and the time constraint that we have. Implementing all of the functions was probably the hardest part of the lab. The point distribution seemed fair and just. The lab manual was enough to start the lab but was very lacking when we got further into the lab getting closer to the end. Many questions I had were only answered with the help of the TAâ€™s The examples in class helped a lot and I would like to see more of those in the future for the future labs.
