This lab is the last lab in which we create a Role Playing Game in which we traverse many rooms. Each room is encrypted and we must decrypt each file in order to keep moving to the next room. We also use the unix server rather than an IDE to test the code and see that it works. The initial set up of the Unix server and the MakeFile are very important parts of this lab and need to be perfect in order for the lab to work at all. The lab manual does go in depth of the MakeFile but does not really discuss the process of connecting to the unix server. The other files were more straight forward but required a lot of work to make it work because we were using new code like fopen, fread, fgetc, and fclose. 

My initial approach to the lab was to setup everything and understand how to connect to the Unix server which took a long time. The TA’s at section were able to help with that. After setting up the lab, I read through the lab manual and began coding the MakeFile. The MakeFile was pretty straight forward. The other source files seemed fine. When trying to run the code on the Unix server I was receiving a message saying “Segmentation fault” and then I had to fix the memory leak in my code which took some time to fix. After fixing that issue, there were other issues but were much easier to fix. If I were to do this lab again I would definitely I understand the new code we were going to use because fread was very difficult to use. The only people I worked with were the TA’s at the last Friday section. 

I believe the lab is working fine but I am not 100% sure. I would say roughly 15-20 hours were spent on this lab due to the decoding that took a while to fix. I enjoyed the fact that we were interacting other files and using the Unix server. I did not like all of the initial setup and decoding because it was much more difficult to decode with the Unix server. I believe the lab was worthwhile because we understand how to interact with files and manipulate them outside of a IDE. I would help the students understand the VT100 code because we had to look up that stuff ourselves. I would like to see some pseudocode for some of the functions due to their difficulty. I think the decryption and decoding the lab was very difficult. The point distribution seems a little off considering Game.c was worth so many points. The lab manual did not talk about the Unix server set up so I do not think that it was enough to start off. Some of the examples Professor Dunne talked about in class did help because I did not know how to use the file based code.
