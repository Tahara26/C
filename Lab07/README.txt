In this lab we design a functional toaster oven on the OLED of our pic32 and have button functionalities that go along with it. The student must draw the toaster oven itself given the special ascii characters. Then updated after certain button presses and many other functionalities that were also included as well. All of the functions were provided in the library so we did not have to make any of those. I believe the long press and the button functionalities of this lab were very important and needed to be absolutely correct in order for the lab to work. The ADC conversion also had to be accurate so the numbers displayed would be correct. 

I read through the manual at the very beginning and careful setup the lab as the lab manual said to do by making the enums and the struct at the very beginning and then began to draw the toaster oven. I kept making sprintf statements but later realized we weren’t allowed to keep making sprintf statements so I later made a function that would print the whole toaster and mode and settings at the bottom of the lab. Then I went through the state machine and slowly worked my way through the pseudocode and finally made it to the end. I kept getting stuck at the long press section of the pending selector change but finally fixed that. Also the countdown was a issue and I had trouble working out the math in order to complete that task. If I were to work on this lab again I would make sure I understand what the state machine was saying before trying to code something I didn’t understand. I mainly got help from the TA’s at section. 

The lab was quite similar to the last lab with many of the same functions. My lab seems like it works fine according to the video and should be fine. The lab did take some time to understand and fully make sense so I would say it took around 20 hours in total to code and fix. I loved worked with the hardware and making something that was actually functional. I disliked all of the code that had to do with the led because it was very unclear on how specific the leds had to be. I think it was a worthwhile lab. I would change the led part or have some pseudo algorithm for that part so that students can understand how to do it. I believe the state changes and the implementation of the switch case statement was the most difficult part. The point distribution seemed fair. I think the lab manual had enough information to start the lab but not enough to finish the lab. I think in class examples helped but we could always use more. The video was also pretty vague on showing how the lab was supposed to work.
