This lab is broken up into three different parts. Before doing any of the parts the use must set up a Leds.h file to use for this lab and future labs as well. The first actual part is the LED bounce part where the LEDs will bounce from one side to the other and keep doing this in a infinite loop. There is also switches that slows down the speed of the bounce with each switch that is up. I believe the ISR part of part 1 was very unclear in the lab manual and I had a difficult time understanding what it was that I had to do in this section. The next part is the ADC with the dial and converting the number into a percentage and displaying it on the OLED. Setting up the ISR for this part was also very crucial. Using simple algebra and sprintf and OledDrawString, the use is able to display the values onto the OLED in the Pic32. The third part of the lab is the button and switches changing the state of the LEDs on the board. The use must first set up the Buttons.c file and make all of the functions in the Buttons.h file and then they may move on. The lab manual was very vague on what to do in this section. The next step is to make the ISR in this part and make sure it checks for events and then finally implement the main. 

My approach to the lab was to read through the lab manual to understand the lab and then I proceeded to go to the lab section on Friday to get further help. I believe steps I took were a little bit different then how the lab manual wanted it so I had some mistakes here and there where I had to go back and fix.
